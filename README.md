# Rock paper scissors üóøüìÉ‚úÇÔ∏è

For this exercise I recreated the classic rock paper scissors game.

## Objectives

### Must-have features

- Have three buttons that the player can press to pick their weapon of choice :white_check_mark:
- Have a play button to have the computer pick one randomly :white_check_mark:
- Announce the winner :white_check_mark:
  - No alert box, add a message to your html
  - Possible outcomes: draw (when both chose the same thing) or player won/lost
- Show a play again button after a game ended :white_check_mark:
- Nice graphics :white_check_mark: (or at least, I tried)
- Different end message styling depending on the outcome (hint: you might need to add or remove classes via JavaScript for this) :white_check_mark:
- Clean your code :white_check_mark:
  - Delete unused code or out of date comments
  - Try to write hard to understand parts in a way that's easier to understand for other developers
  - Can you use functions to make your code easier to read or reuse?

### Nice-to-have features

- Keep track of the score after multiple games :white_check_mark:
- Show what the player picked by highlighting the correct button :white_check_mark:

These are also nice-to-have features but I did not start on these yet:

- Add more options for a player to choose from (example: a risky option that awards more points but has a higher chance of losing)
- Add even more options (but avoid using 100 if statements)
- Can you make a player win 100% of the games? Or win 75%? (not to raise any suspicion)

### TODO

- Restart the game button
- Get an error message when no button is selected
